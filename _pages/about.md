I am Dong Shu, a Master's student in Computer Science at Northwestern University. I previously earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Rutgers University.

Currently, I work closely with [Prof. Yongfeng Zhang](https://yongfeng.me/), [Prof. Mengnan Du](https://mengnandu.com/), and [Prof. David Demeter](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/demeter-david.html) on projects spanning various fields. My research interests are diverse yet interconnected, focusing on applying large language models (LLMs) across multiple domains, including AI4Science, multimodal AI, AI applications in law and biology, and explainable AI.
